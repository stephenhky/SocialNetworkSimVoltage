# SocialNetworkSimVoltage
Exploring the connections within a network by making electrical resistance as an analogy.

* `SimVolGraph.py`: seeing the network as systems of linear equations as electrical resistance
* `SocialNetworkSimVoltage.py`: seeing the network as directional graph, as diode
* `resistancedist.py`: solving the resistance as in <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_distance>
